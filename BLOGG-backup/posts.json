Django is a full-featured, “batteries-included” framework that provides built-in components like an ORM, authentication, and an admin panel, making it ideal for larger projects and rapid development. Flask, on the other hand, is a lightweight and flexible micro-framework that gives developers more control and freedom to choose components, perfect for smaller applications or when you want to build your stack from scratch. Django enforces a project structure and conventions, which can speed up development but feel restrictive, while Flask’s minimalistic approach offers simplicity and extensibility.",
